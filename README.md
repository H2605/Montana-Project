# Montana-Project

A/B testing compares two versions of a website or an app to see which version works better. The two versions are labelled A and B and are randomly displayed to the users.

This project is about conducting an A/B test using Montana University as an example, with a scenario described as follows:


The Library of Montana State University has a website that students use to find books and articles. This is how the Home page  like:

Below the library picture there is a search bar and three big items: “Find”, “Request”and “Interact”. All three of them contain access to important 
information and services that the library prides itself in offering. However, the Website Analytics show that the “Interact” button has, ironically, 
almost no interactions:

The way to measure how each one of the three categories perform is by click-through rate (CTR), a common term in Online Marketing which typically describes the number of clicks an ad receives divided by the number of times the ad is shown. Here, click-through rate is measured as the number of clicks on each item divided by the total number of visits on the website. The report from the team analysing the website shows the specific numbers and explains how they reacted to them:

  "During the sample period from April 3, 2013 – April 10, 2013, which included 10,819 visits to the library homepage, there was a large disparity among the three main content categories. The click-through rate for Find was 35%, Request was 6%, and Interact was 2%. This observation prompted a question: “Why are Interact clicks so low?” At this time the content beneath Interact included links to Reference Services, Instruction Services, Subject Liaisons, Writing Center, About, Staff Directory, Library FAQ, Give to the Library, and Floor Maps. The library’s web committee surmised that introducing this category with the abstract term “Interact” added difficulty and confusion for users trying to navigate into the library website homepage. Four different category titles were then proposed as variations to be tested: Connect, Learn, Help, and Services."

In an A/B Test, one of the tasks that usually belongs to the UX team is to perform user research and develop a new version of the website element that needs to be tested. The team had conversations with a few students and asked the following questions:
Have you previously clicked on Interact?

- What content do you expect to see after you select Interact?
- Does Interact accurately describe the content that you find after selecting Interact?
- Which word best describes this category? Interact? Connect? Learn? Help? Services?

Here are some of the responses from three of the students.

Sophomore student:

- “I didn’t know that ‘About’ was under Interact.'”
- “Learn doesn’t work.”
- “Connect is too vague and too close to Interact.”
- “Services is more accurate. Help is stronger.”
- “Floor maps seem odd here.”
- In order of preferences of the choices, this student responded: Help, Services, Interact, Connect, Learn

Junior student:

- “I am not a native English speaker, so I look for strong words. I look for help, so Help is the best, then Services too.”

Senior student:

- “I’ve never felt the need to click on Interact. What am I interacting with? I guess the library?”
- “I never knew floor maps were there, but I have wondered before where certain rooms were.”
- “Help makes sense. When I’m in the library, and I think I need help, it would at least get me to click there to find out what sort of help there is.”
- “Services also works.”
- “Learn doesn’t really work. I just think, What am I learning? I think of reading a book or something.”
- “Connect is better than Interact, but neither are very good.”

After these interviews, how would you proceed to design an experiment that would improve the website?
